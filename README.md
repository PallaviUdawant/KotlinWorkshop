# Covid-19 Updates

This app gives the insights about the current covid-19 statistics.
This app is build in Kotlin and following Kotlin features have been used in the app.

- Replaced findviewById by synthetic binding to access the view components and databinding.  
- Used higher order function concept where the function expression is done in just one line. 
- Along with this while using the VolleyString request I have used lambda expression.
- Use of bang bang operator.
